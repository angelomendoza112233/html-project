                    <p>
                        During my Senior High School studies at Asian college of technology , I completed a capstone
                        project where
                        I applied the knowledge and skills I learned in class to solve a real-world problem. I was
                        responsible for planning, researching, and developing the project, either independently or as
                        part of a team. I used tools such as [insert tools, software, or materials you used] to create
                        and test our solution. The project improved my skills in critical thinking, teamwork,
                        communication, and time management. At the end of the process, I presented and defended the
                        project in front of a panel as part of our academic requirements. </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond technical growth, this experience helped me develop essential professional skills
                        including effective communication, team collaboration, adaptive problem-solving, and project
                        management – all while contributing meaningfully to organizational goals.

                    <h4>GOYO Computer Company (Internship)</h4>
                    <span class="date">March 2023 – May 2023</span>
                    <p>
                        I worked part-time at a computer parts shop where I supported daily operations and provided
                        technical assistance to customers. My responsibilities included helping customers select
                        compatible hardware components for custom PC builds, performing basic troubleshooting and
                        repairs, and installing parts such as RAM, SSDs, GPUs, and cooling systems. I also managed
                        inventory, restocked shelves, and organized product displays to maintain a clean and efficient
                        work environment. In addition, I handled point-of-sale transactions and assisted in order
                        processing. This role strengthened my knowledge of computer hardware, improved my customer
                        service and problem-solving skills, and gave me experience working in a fast-paced retail
                        setting.
